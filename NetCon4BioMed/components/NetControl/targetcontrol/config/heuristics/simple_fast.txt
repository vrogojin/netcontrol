## All heuristics in this file include the optimization that trims control paths at already driven nodes.
##
## Avoid cycles.
T F 1 (->A)(->T)
## Consider the parent nodes in the following order:
## - already driven nodes
## - nodes that are on controlled path and do not enclose a cycle on the current path
## - nodes that have already been considered on other paths, and which do not enclose a cycle on the current path
## - new nodes (which have not been considered on the current or other paths so far in the algorithm)
## - all other nodes (basically nodes which enclose cycles)
T F 1 (->D)(->CA)(->PA)(->N)(->T)
## Same as the above, but prioritize the following first:
## - edges that are part of already controlled paths
## - edges that are part of other paths already considered by the algorithm
