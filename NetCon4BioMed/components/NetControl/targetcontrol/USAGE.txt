This package provides several tools for computations related to
the target control of directed networks. To run the available tools,
first execute:

./tc_console

This will start a subshell which will make our tools available in the
$PATH environment variable. Moreover, it will enable you to use the
$TC_PATH variable, which points to the location of the 'tc_console'
script on your system. This allows you, for example, to easily refer
to files included in the package (such as heuristics files).

Available scripts:

target_control
targets_by_degree
cumulative_control

Run each of them with the '--help' flag for more information.
